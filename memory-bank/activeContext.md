## Active Decisions and Considerations

As we continue working with this project, we're making and considering the following decisions:

1. **Template Syntax vs. Linter Validation** - Balancing Django template syntax with JavaScript linting requirements.

2. **Search Performance** - Evaluating the performance impact of complex search queries on large datasets.

3. **UI Complexity vs. Functionality** - Finding the right balance between power features and intuitive UI.

4. **Mobile UX for Advanced Features** - Ensuring complex features like advanced search remain usable on smaller screens.

5. **Progressive Enhancement** - Implementing features in a way that gracefully degrades when JavaScript is unavailable.

6. **User Experience Considerations** - Continuing to evaluate the user experience with a focus on:
   - Intuitiveness
   - Efficiency
   - Responsiveness
   - Accessibility
