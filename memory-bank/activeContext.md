# Active Context

## Current Work Focus

The project is currently in the initialization phase. We are establishing the memory bank structure to document the Task Manager application and its components. Our immediate focus is on:

1. **Documentation** - Creating a comprehensive set of memory bank files to capture the project's purpose, structure, and technical details.

2. **Project Understanding** - Analyzing the existing codebase to understand its architecture, components, and functionality.

3. **Establishing Baseline** - Creating a baseline for future development and enhancements.

## Recent Changes

As this is the initialization phase, the recent changes include:

1. **Memory Bank Creation** - Establishing the core memory bank files:
   - projectbrief.md
   - productContext.md
   - systemPatterns.md
   - techContext.md
   - activeContext.md
   - progress.md

2. **Code Exploration** - Initial analysis of the codebase to understand:
   - Model structure and relationships
   - View organization
   - Template design
   - Authentication flow
   - Project organization

## Next Steps

The immediate next steps include:

1. **Complete Memory Bank** - Finalize the progress.md file to capture the current project status.

2. **Establish .cursorrules** - Create a .cursorrules file to capture important project patterns and conventions.

3. **Deeper Code Analysis** - Conduct more detailed analysis of key system components:
   - Task management functionality
   - Project management functionality
   - AI integration
   - User authentication and management

4. **Identify Enhancement Opportunities** - Based on the code analysis, identify areas for potential improvements or enhancements.

5. **Environment Setup** - Confirm the development environment is properly set up for future work.

## Active Decisions and Considerations

As we begin working with this project, we're making and considering the following decisions:

1. **Documentation Level** - How detailed should the memory bank files be? The current approach is comprehensive but focuses on key architectural and functional aspects without documenting every detail.

2. **Feature Assessment** - Identifying which features are fully implemented, partially implemented, or planned for future development.

3. **Code Quality Assessment** - Evaluating the existing code quality, patterns, and potential areas for improvement.

4. **Priority Framework** - Establishing criteria for prioritizing future work:
   - User impact
   - Technical debt reduction
   - Feature completeness
   - Performance optimization

5. **AI Integration Approach** - Understanding the current approach to AI integration and potential enhancements:
   - Natural language processing
   - Task automation
   - Intelligent suggestions
   - Productivity insights

6. **User Experience Considerations** - Evaluating the current user experience with a focus on:
   - Intuitiveness
   - Efficiency
   - Responsiveness
   - Accessibility
