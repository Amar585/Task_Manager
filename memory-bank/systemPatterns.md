# System Patterns

## System Architecture

The Nexus application follows a typical Django MVT (Model-View-Template) architecture with several components working together to provide a complete task management solution.

### Architecture Overview

### Core Components

1. **Django Project (mysite)** - The main project container
   - Configuration and settings
   - URL routing
   - WSGI/ASGI applications

2. **Authentication App (auth_app)** - Handles user authentication and management
   - User model and registration
   - Supabase integration for authentication
   - Webhooks for user sync

3. **Tasks App (tasks)** - Core task management functionality
   - Task and project models
   - Task creation, retrieval, updating, and deletion
   - Task-related features (attachments, comments, etc.)

4. **Chatbot Integration** - AI functionality for task automation
   - Natural language processing
   - Task suggestions and creation
   - Productivity insights

### Data Flow

1. **User Request Flow**
   - Browser sends request to Django server
   - URLs.py routes to appropriate view
   - View processes request and interacts with models
   - Template renders response
   - Response returned to browser

2. **Task Creation Flow**
   - User submits task form
   - View validates data
   - Task model instance created
   - Signals trigger related actions (notifications, webhooks)
   - Response confirms creation

3. **Authentication Flow**
   - User submits credentials
   - Supabase authentication processes request
   - Success/failure response returned
   - Webhook synchronizes user data with Django

## Key Technical Decisions

### Authentication Strategy

The application uses a hybrid authentication approach:
- Supabase handles primary user authentication (registration, login, password reset)
- Django maintains a synchronized user model for authorization and app functionality
- Webhooks ensure both systems remain in sync

### Database Schema Design

The database schema follows these principles:
- UUID primary keys for distributed system compatibility
- Comprehensive relationship modeling (ForeignKeys, ManyToMany)
- Strategic use of indexes for performance
- Audit fields for tracking creation and modification

### Frontend Approach

The frontend employs a progressive enhancement strategy:
- Server-side rendered HTML for core functionality
- JavaScript for enhanced interactivity where appropriate
- CSS for styling and animations
- Bootstrap for responsive design framework

### API Design

The API follows RESTful principles:
- Resource-oriented endpoints
- Standard HTTP methods for CRUD operations
- Consistent response formats
- Authentication via tokens

## Design Patterns

### Repository Pattern

The models themselves act as repositories, with Django's ORM providing the interface for data access:
- Models encapsulate data access logic
- Views interact with models, not directly with the database
- Custom manager methods for complex queries

### Service Layer Pattern

Complex business logic is encapsulated in service-like modules:
- TaskService for task-related operations
- ProjectService for project operations
- Prevents views from containing business logic

### Observer Pattern (via Django Signals)

The system uses Django's signals to implement the observer pattern:
- Models fire signals on changes
- Signal handlers respond to events
- Decouples event generation from handling

### Command Pattern

Form processing implements a command-like pattern:
- Forms encapsulate data validation and processing
- View calls form's save/process method
- Separates data validation from business logic

### Strategy Pattern

For features like notifications, a strategy pattern is used:
- Common interface for different notification methods
- Concrete implementations for email, in-app, etc.
- Runtime selection of appropriate strategy

## Component Relationships

### User - Project - Task Hierarchy

```
User
 │
 ├── Owns Projects
 │    │
 │    └── Contains Tasks
 │         │
 │         ├── Has Comments
 │         ├── Has Attachments
 │         ├── Has Time Entries
 │         └── Has Custom Field Values
 │
 ├── Assigned to Tasks
 │
 └── Creates Activities
```

### Task Relationships

```
Task
 │
 ├── Parent Task
 │    │
 │    └── Subtasks
 │
 ├── Dependencies
 │    │
 │    └── Dependent Tasks
 │
 ├── Project (optional)
 │
 ├── Assignees
 │
 ├── Tags
 │
 ├── Comments
 │
 ├── Attachments
 │
 ├── Reminders
 │
 ├── Time Entries
 │
 ├── Custom Field Values
 │
 ├── Activities
 │
 └── Versions
```

These relationships form the backbone of the application's data model and drive the functionality of the system.
