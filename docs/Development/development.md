### üöÄ Ultimate Task Manager + AI Chatbot Roadmap using Django



---

#### Phase 1: üîê Authentication & User Management

**Core Features:**

- **User Registration:**
  - Email/password signup via Supabase
  - Email verification process
  - Password strength validation
  - Acceptance of terms of service

- **User Login:**
  - Email/password login with "Remember me" functionality (extended JWT expiry)
  - Tracking of failed login attempts with account lockout after multiple failures

- **Account Management:**
  - Password reset through email
  - Email change process with re-verification
  - Account deletion with a soft delete mechanism and a grace period for recovery

- **Security Measures:**
  - JWT refresh tokens with a long expiry period and access tokens with a shorter expiry
  - Session management dashboard with an option to force logout from all devices

**Implementation Steps:**

- Set up Django using `django-allauth` and `supabase-py`
- Create a custom User model (example below):

  ```python
  class User(AbstractUser):
      email_verified = models.BooleanField(default=False)
      deleted_at = models.DateTimeField(null=True)
      last_password_change = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
  ```

- Build middleware for JWT validation and implement rate limiting using `django-ratelimit`

**Error Handling:**

- Return **401 Unauthorized** for invalid tokens
- Return **403 Forbidden** for unverified accounts
- Return **429 Too Many Requests** for brute force attempts
- Return **410 Gone** for deleted accounts

**Testing Checklist:**

- Validate email verification flow
- Confirm account recovery during the grace period
- Test concurrent sessions management
- Verify brute force protection measures

#### Phase 2: üìù Task Management System

**Core Features:**

- **Task CRUD Operations:**
  - Create tasks with details such as title, description, due date, and priority
  - Support for task templates and bulk operations (delete/update)
  - Maintain task version history

- **Task Organization:**
  - Organize tasks by projects or workspaces
  - Utilize tags, labels, and drag-and-drop prioritization
  - Archive tasks with the option to recover

- **Collaboration:**
  - Assign tasks to team members
  - Add comments and maintain an activity log with mention notifications
  - Attach files using Supabase storage

- **Advanced Features:**
  - Support task dependencies and time tracking
  - Allow custom fields and export capabilities (CSV/PDF)

**Implementation Steps:**

- Design a robust database schema. For example:

  ```python
  class Task(models.Model):
      STATUS_CHOICES = [('TODO', 'To Do'), ('DONE', 'Done')]
      title = models.CharField(max_length=200)
      description = models.RichTextField()
      due_date = models.DateTimeField()
      status = models.CharField(max_length=4, choices=STATUS_CHOICES)
      parent_task = models.ForeignKey('self', on_delete=models.CASCADE, null=True)
  ```

- Implement optimistic UI updates and set up task change signals for notifications
- Integrate versioning support using `django-reversion`

**Error Handling:**

- Return **403 Forbidden** for unauthorized task modifications
- Return **409 Conflict** when task dependency rules are violated
- Return **413 Payload Too Large** for oversized file attachments
- Return **423 Locked** when tasks are concurrently edited

**Testing Checklist:**

- Verify task dependency validation and concurrent editing safeguards
- Test file attachment limits and export functionality

---

#### Phase 3: ü§ñ AI Chatbot Integration

**Core Features:**

- **Natural Language Processing:**
  - Create tasks via chat (e.g., "Add task: Buy milk tomorrow")
  - Query and update tasks using natural language

- **Automation:**
  - Create automation rules through chat (e.g., "If task is overdue, notify manager")
  - Support scheduled commands and bulk actions

- **Learning System:**
  - Allow custom command training and contextual memory
  - Implement a feedback loop to improve accuracy

**Implementation Steps:**

- Set up Rasa Open Source:

  ```bash
  pip install rasa
  rasa init --no-prompt
  ```

- Define the domain in `domain.yml` (with intents like `create_task`, `query_tasks`, `set_reminder`)
- Connect the chatbot to Django using FastAPI middleware and implement an asynchronous task queue with Celery

**Error Handling:**

- Return **400 Bad Request** for ambiguous commands
- Return **501 Not Implemented** for unsupported features
- Return **504 Timeout** for long-running operations

**Testing Checklist:**

- Validate natural language understanding and automation rule execution
- Test context persistence and proper timeout handling

---

#### Phase 4: ‚ö° Advanced Automation

**Core Features:**

- **Visual Workflow Builder:**
  - Offer a drag-and-drop interface for building workflows
  - Enable conditional logic and multi-step process design

- **Integration Hub:**
  - Integrate with email/SMS, calendar sync, and webhook services

- **Scheduled Automation:**
  - Support daily, weekly, or monthly triggers
  - Provide time-based delays and event-based triggers

**Implementation Steps:**

- Deploy an automation tool like n8n using Docker:

  ```bash
  docker run -d --name n8n -p 5678:5678 n8nio/n8n
  ```

- Create API endpoints for trigger registration and build a UI wrapper for the n8n editor
- Implement encryption for stored credentials

**Error Handling:**

- Return **424 Failed Dependency** for trigger failures
- Return **503 Service Unavailable** during maintenance periods
- Return **507 Insufficient Storage** when logging workflow data

**Testing Checklist:**

- Test complex workflow chains and credential security
- Validate failure recovery processes and load handling under heavy automation

---

#### Phase 5: üöÄ Deployment & Scaling

**Core Features:**

- **Production Deployment:**
  - Containerize the application with Docker
  - Utilize load balancing and zero-downtime deployment techniques

- **Monitoring:**
  - Collect performance metrics and track errors
  - Monitor usage analytics

- **Maintenance:**
  - Set up automated backups and disaster recovery plans
  - Implement a CI/CD pipeline for continuous integration and deployment
